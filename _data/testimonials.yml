You were one of the first guys working on this and I know it was a lot of ups and downs and changes regarding the product - for me personally exhausting but also very exciting and I loved how u dealt with that and were open minded and ready to throw things away and head in new directions. I enjoyed working with u and hope ways will cross again!"
